Are they stores that were built as Supercenters?

    "Now let's think about the director and actor columns. You might be asking — isn't it bad practice to have potentially multiple individuals contained in a single string? The short answer is yes. It turns out that this data originated from a JSON export from a MongoDB (non-relational or NoSQL) database, where the director and actor columns were actually lists of strings. This nested data-type representation doesn't translate well to the relational row-column format of a `pandas` DataFrame, which is why we have the non-ideal situation where multiple individuals are contained in a single string in a single column. We could blow up the director and actor columns into multiple columns, but then we run into a couple of different problems: what happens to films with differently sized casts? Do we only store the X most important cast members? These are data model design questions that I'll leave as an exercise to the reader.\n",

This pesky data type is technically a `float` but usually represents a missing data point. Rather than break the entire `pd.read_csv()` operation, `pandas` just assumed you meant to have a missing value in that cell and populated it by default with `numpy.nan` instead. (Note that the native Python `math` module has an implementation of `nan` as well.)\n",

    "Why don't we take a look in our DataFrame and see where (if at all) we have `nan` values? We'll use a Boolean mask to do so. Recall this topic from this weekend's section as well. As a refresher, a Boolean mask is an array of True/False values that correspond to the result of some operation — in this case the `pd.DataFrame.isnull()` method — and we can use it as a mask to restrict our DataFrame to a subset of rows that correspond to only the True values in our Boolean mask. \n",
